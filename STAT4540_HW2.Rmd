### Problem 1

An explicit example of uncorrelated variables that aren't independent would be: $$Y=X^2$$

We can show this through assigning X to a uniform distribution, $X\sim U(0,1)$, and then defining Y as previously stated.

```{r, error=FALSE}
X <- runif(1,0,1)
Y <- X^2
corr_val = cor(X,Y, method = "pearson")
corr_val
```

These two variables are **dependent** as X defines Y, but they're **uncorrelated**.
